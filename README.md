# Personal Github Pages Setup with React + TypeScript + Vite

This site was created with great appreciation to developers who have contributed to:

- Vite
- React
- Typescript
- Emotion
- React Router DOM
- Yarn
- Eslint
- Prettier
- VsCode
- Github

When spinning up this site, I initially started off using CRA but it felt a bit clunky and
dependencies were outdated. I switched to Vite and found it a much better experience. I also
opted to write my own css with some tools to clamp my typography and space for a more fluid
and responsive layout. The site follows accessibility best practices. Testing was performed
using Axe DevTools, VoiceOver, and keyboard.

Feel free to take a look at my code. I opted to leave it public so that it could be used as a sample of my coding practice.
